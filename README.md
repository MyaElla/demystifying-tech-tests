# Tech Test Workshop

You can pick one of the following sample take home tech tests to work on this evening. You can choose to do them in any programming language of your choice.
You will typically have a few days to complete most of these tests so do not expect to finish within this session. The aim of the workshop is to plan
your solution with the help of a coach and get started.
