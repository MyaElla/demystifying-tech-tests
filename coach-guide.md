# Some Best Practices

These are some general best practices to encourage your students to do during the session. Given the limited time, you might not be able to cover all these points in detail (writing tests for example) but
it could be useful to point them in the right direction so they can work on it on their own time.

1. Sketch out a plan before starting - plan the main pieces of your program and how they might fit together.
2. TDD (test-driven development) - include unit tests.
3. Make it readable
..* Take care when naming classes, methods/functions, and variables. Names should describe what the thing does, or what it represents. Choose a name that reminds the reader what is stored inside the variable.
..* Break it down - Short and concise methods over long and complex ones.
..* Use comments sparingly - code that is easy to understand is always better than a comment.
4. Follow the programming style of your language - if you choose a OO language, make sure to write object-oriented code.
5. Make sure you are handling any edge cases (if you aren't, acknowledge these edge cases to demonstrate that you have thought about it.)
6. Refactor your solution!
7. Include a README - your documentation should include what your code will do, how to run your code and the technologies you've used. You can also talk about the problems you ran into, why you took the approach you did, what you might do differently or additionally if you had more time.
